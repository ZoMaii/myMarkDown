# FIND YOUR NEEDS

This is a simple tools for markdown on native ES6.

The work of the project depends on the support of ES6 scripts in the program (client side). html elements are written according to the recommendations of MDN.

You can integrate it into any environment that supports ES6, provided that you provide **html files** _instead of_ **md files** for this project.
